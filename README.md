# Back to Code: My AI/ML Reboot

👋 Hi, I’m an executive taking a bold step: back to the terminal. This repo is my sandbox as I relearn the foundations of machine learning, AI, and large language models — not from the sidelines, but through hands-on work.

## What You'll Find Here
- 📘 Notebooks from courses & experiments
- 🛠️ Mini-projects in Python, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face
- 🤖 My first LLM experiments with LangChain & OpenAI APIs
- 🧠 Thoughts on applying AI at scale in enterprise

## Why?
To understand what it truly takes to build and scale modern AI — and become a better, more empathetic leader for the teams driving that innovation.
